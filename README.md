A Unity VFX Graph sample of a floating HUD effect.

### Known issue

Due to an issue with scripted importers and shader graphs, the `WebcamFilter`
shader graph (`Assets/FloatingHUD/Webcam/WebcamFilter.shadergraph`) doesn't
work correctly with an initial project import. You can fix the issue by
reimporting it manually from the context menu.
